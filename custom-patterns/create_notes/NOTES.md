# v0.1.1
See the notes I generated in OpenWebUI w/ llama3.2; at first using the create notes prompt.  It
produced very terse output, so I asked it:

> Rewrite the notes with greater detail.  Produce a section for each topic or idea.

... and got much better output.


See `second-brain/Resources/Courses/Advent Pluralsight Challenge/Day 4 - Top<blah blah>/transcripts/`
- The `top-blah-blah-ollama-llama3.2_create_notes.md` was where I prompted with the `create_notes`
- The `-modified` is when I, in the same thread, gave the prompt cited above.
