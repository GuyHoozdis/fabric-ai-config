# INSTRUCTIONS
Below are a list of changes made to the codebase.  Please review these changes and generate a short list of high-level changes to the codebase.  Do not repeat the granular detail of each commit message.  Think about the result of collated changes and express the important aspects or concepts as short one line descriptions.  The output should be appropriate for a changelog.  The audience for this content is managers and product owners so the level of technical detail should be appropriately high-level for that audience.

# RULES
Rules for generating line items:
- Do not include version bumping.
- Do not include the word "changelog", "diff", or "commit" in the output.
- Do not include merge commits.

# OUTPUT TEMPLATE
Format the output with the following structure:

Start with a one or two line summary of the changes, e.g. "This release includes bug fixes and performance improvements."
- <short description of change 1>
- <short description of change 2>
